# Spatiotemporal-Sea-Surface-Temperature-Prediction-
 
This repository implements the paper ["Spatiotemporal Sea Surface Temperature Prediction Using Time Series Satellite Data and Machine Learning Algorithms: A Comprehensive Study"]


## Requirements
- Python 3.6.7
- Tensorflow 2.1.0 
- Others

## Introduction 
The study intended to take advantage of the recent development in ML approaches and attempt to perform a comprehensive experimental study.

Our proposals included: 
1. Development of a one-month ahead SST predictions based on 6 different ML models 
2. Comparison of model performances
3. Evaluation of results

## Example Results
Comparison of original monthly SST and predicted SST images for 12 months.

## Run
1. If you want to run models, first go "CallMLModels",   
   - Execute "CallMLModels" file
